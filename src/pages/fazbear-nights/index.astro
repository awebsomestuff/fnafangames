<h3>How to Play Fazbear Nights</h3>
Playing Fazbear Nights requires a combination of strategy, quick reflexes, and an understanding of the animatronics' behavior. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you get started:
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Survive the Nights</strong>: Your primary goal is to survive five nights while avoiding animatronics. Use cameras, doors, and your flashlight wisely, as power is limited.</li>
 	<li><strong>Explore the Environment</strong>: Unlike traditional FNaF games, you can move around the pizzeria. Explore different rooms to find useful items and secrets that can aid in your survival.</li>
 	<li><strong>Manage Power Wisely</strong>: Keep an eye on your power consumption. Overusing cameras and doors can drain your power, leaving you vulnerable.</li>
 	<li><strong>Use Audio Cues</strong>: Pay attention to sound effects. Animatronics make specific noises that can give you clues about their location and intentions.</li>
 	<li><strong>Master the Animatronics</strong>: Each animatronic has unique behaviors. For example, Foxy may knock on doors, draining power, while Freddy requires careful monitoring to predict his movements.</li>
