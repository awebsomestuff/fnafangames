<h3>How to Play Five Nights at Maggie's 3</h3>

<center><div class="yt-facade" data-vid="1xx5DfDVDwY" style="max-width:560px;aspect-ratio:560/315"><img src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/1xx5DfDVDwY/hqdefault.jpg" alt="Play video" loading="lazy" width="560" height="315"><button class="yt-play" aria-label="Play video">&#9654;</button></div></center>
<ol>
 	<li><strong>Night 1:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Introduces three main antagonists: Bob, Lolo, and Rolf. Bob and Lolo function similarly to the classic Bonnie and Chica from FNAF 1. Keep an eye on them using the cameras and shut the doors when necessary.</li>
 	<li>Rolf requires special attention through the vent system, which can be monitored on a separate tab. Use the flashlight to force him back.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Night 2:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Ester and Lester make their appearance as a duo, requiring you to manage vent systems more actively. Use the provided button to close vents when they appear and shut down the power in emergencies.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Night 3:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Maggie and Crackie join the fray. Maggie’s mechanics resemble Rolf’s, while Crackie demands constant surveillance on CAM 1. Failure to monitor Crackie leads to a tense encounter that can only be avoided by closing both doors.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Night 4:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Introduces Cerdi, a challenging new enemy. Cerdi’s attacks are signaled by glitching noises, and players must use the camera system to locate and stun him by shutting down power in specific rooms.</li>
</ul>
</li>
 	<li><strong>Post-Night Mini-Games:</strong>
<ul>
 	<li>Each night ends with mini-games that provide crucial story elements, revealing the dark history of Maggie's Magical World and its inhabitants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
