<h4>Objective</h4>
<div class="description-section">Your role in the game is simple yet terrifying: you must survive for six consecutive nights, each night lasting from midnight until 7 AM. Your task is to keep Ramiz Games and Grub secure by monitoring the surroundings and reacting quickly to any strange occurrences.</div>
<h4>Controls and Mechanics</h4>
<div class="skills-section">
<div class="skills-grid">
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Monitor Cameras</strong>: Use the in-game surveillance system to monitor different areas of the building. Stay vigilant for any unusual activity from the animatronic characters.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Manage Doors and Lights</strong>: Control the doors and lights in your office to protect yourself from the characters when they get too close. Make sure to conserve your power, as overuse of these systems can lead to dangerous situations.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>React to Threats</strong>: Each animatronic has a unique attack pattern. For example, you need to deal with Merry by turning to your left at the right time, and Berry requires quick reaction timing.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Survive Until 7 AM</strong>: The main goal is to survive the night until 7 AM without being attacked by the animatronics. Keep track of your resources and manage them efficiently to stay safe.</div>
</div>
</div>
<h4>Tips for Success</h4>

<div class="skills-grid">

<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Understand Animatronic Behavior</strong>: Each animatronic character behaves differently. Spend time learning their movement patterns to better anticipate and counter their attacks.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Utilize the Brightness Option</strong>: If you're having trouble seeing, you can increase the game’s brightness by hitting the "+" key on your keyboard’s numpad.</div>
<div class="skill-steps"><strong>Stay Calm</strong>: Don’t panic when things get intense. Staying focused and following your strategy is the key to survival.</div>
