<h3>How to Play Five Nights at Freddy's: In Real Time</h3>
This game retains the core mechanics of the original FNAF while introducing new elements. Your goal is to survive five nights at Freddy Fazbear's Pizza by monitoring the animatronics through CCTV cameras. However, in this version, animatronics move in real time, adding a new layer of challenge and immersion.
<h4>Gameplay Tips:</h4>
<ul>
 	<li><strong>Monitor Animatronics Closely:</strong> Unlike the original game, animatronics in this version move smoothly between camera views. Keep an eye on their movements and anticipate their paths.</li>
 	<li><strong>Manage Power Wisely:</strong> Just like in the original FNAF, power management is crucial. Ensure you’re using doors and cameras efficiently to avoid running out of power before the night ends.</li>
 	<li><strong>New Animations:</strong> Each animatronic has unique animations. For example, Bonnie moves slowly and fluidly, while Chica alternates between stillness and sudden movements. Learn their patterns to anticipate their attacks.</li>
 	<li><strong>Camera Restrictions:</strong> Some camera angles and views have been changed. Learn the new layout quickly to stay ahead of the animatronics.</li>
</ul>
