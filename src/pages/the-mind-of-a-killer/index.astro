</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h3>The Thrill of Free-Roam Gameplay</h3>

You’re not just stuck in a security office — you have the freedom to explore the entire environment. However, this freedom comes with a price: <em>Springtrap</em> and the other phantoms are lurking in the shadows, waiting to strike.</div>
</div>
<div class="feature-item">
<h3>A Dark and Gripping Storyline</h3>

<h3>Animatronics and Threats</h3>
<div class="description-section">The animatronics in "The Mind of a Killer" are a deadly force, led by the relentless <em>Springtrap</em>. But he's not the only one you need to worry about.
